### Highlights

#### Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

* Fix bug where failed container start cleanup leaked tasks and prevented container removal ([#14223](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14223))
* Fix bug where container creation failed when SELinux relabeling was unsupported by the filesystem ([#14212](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14212))

#### Image Distribution

* Fix content upload failures when retrying fetch content after reaching EOF ([#14197](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14197))

#### Snapshotters

* Apply hardening to filter ID-mapping labels from image annotations during unpack ([#14200](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14200))

#### ctr development tool

* Fix bug where arguments following "-" were dropped in "ctr images export" ([#14219](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14219))
* Fix bug where container command arguments were parsed as flags in "ctr run", "ctr containers create", "ctr tasks exec", and "containerd oci-hook" ([#14215](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14215))
* Fix bug where comma-separated flag values were incorrectly split in ctr subcommands ([#14188](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14188))

### Dependency Changes

* **github.com/fxamacker/cbor/v2**  v2.9.1 -> v2.9.4

Previous release can be found at [v2.4.0](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/releases/tag/v2.4.0)
### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on Linux distributions that do not use glibc >= 2.35. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.
