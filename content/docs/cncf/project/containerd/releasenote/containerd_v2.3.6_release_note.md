### Security Updates

  * [**CVE-2026-53493**](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/security/advisories/GHSA-pg57-6jwg-q645)

### Highlights

#### Container Runtime Interface (CRI)

* Fix bug where container creation failed when SELinux relabeling was unsupported by the filesystem ([#14211](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14211))
* Enable mount manager for image mounts in CRI ([#14147](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14147))

#### Image Storage

* Ensure all layers are fetched when multiple manifests in an index share a config descriptor ([#14139](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14139))

#### Runtime

* Avoid unexpected mutation of mount options in mount helpers ([#14192](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14192))
* Mask /proc/interrupts and CPU thermal throttle sysfs paths in Linux containers by default ([#14144](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/pull/14144))
