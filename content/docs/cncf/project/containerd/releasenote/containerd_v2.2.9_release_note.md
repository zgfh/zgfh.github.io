### Which file should I download?
* `containerd-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:         ✅Recommended. Dynamically linked with glibc 2.35 (Ubuntu 22.04).
* `containerd-static-<VERSION>-<OS>-<ARCH>.tar.gz`:  Statically linked. Expected to be used on Linux distributions that do not use glibc >= 2.35. Not position-independent.

In addition to containerd, typically you will have to install [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases)
and [CNI plugins](https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases) from their official sites too.
