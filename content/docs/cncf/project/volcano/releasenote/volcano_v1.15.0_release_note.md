# volcano-sh/volcano v1.15.0 Release Notes

Published at: 2026-06-01T03:33:59Z

## Summary

Volcano v1.15.0 further strengthens Volcano as a unified scheduling platform for converged general-purpose and AI computing at scale. As clusters increasingly run batch training, inference, AI Agent, HPC, big-data, and heterogeneous accelerator workloads together, the scheduler must make higher-quality decisions under resource contention while preserving workload-level semantics, queue fairness, topology locality, and operational stability.

The most important addition is **Gang-Aware Preemption and Resource Reclamation**. It makes eviction decisions gang-aware on both sides: the incoming gang is placed as a unit, and victim jobs are ordered and selected at job/gang granularity to avoid arbitrary partial disruption. v1.15.0 also introduces DRA queue quota in the capacity plugin, pluggable multi-sharding policies, benchmark and performance observability tooling, Kubernetes 1.35 support, NodeGroup preference ordering, Agent Scheduler stability improvements, incremental GPU/vGPU improvements, and opt-in scheduling gates for queue admission control.

## What's New

### Key Features Overview

- **Gang-Aware Preemption and Resource Reclamation (Alpha)**: Makes eviction decisions gang-aware on both sides. Volcano evaluates the preemptor as a whole gang and selects victims at job/gang granularity, reducing random partial disruption across training jobs and supporting HyperNode-scoped victim search when topology is enabled.
- **DRA Queue Quota in Capacity Plugin**: Adds queue quota accounting for Pods that request DRA resources, bringing `ResourceClaim` usage into the existing `capability`, `deserved`, and `guarantee` model.
- **Pluggable Multi-Sharding Policy Support (Alpha)**: Moves sharding configuration from fixed shard parameters to a pluggable policy framework with composable filter, score, and select phases, built-in `allocation-rate`, `warmup`, and `node-limit` policies, and ConfigMap live reload.
- **Volcano Benchmark and Performance Observability**: Provides a benchmark framework for one-click environment setup and performance report collection on Kind/KWOK or existing clusters, helping users establish baseline data and identify scheduler bottlenecks.
- **Scheduling Gates for Queue Admission (Alpha)**: Uses opt-in scheduling gates to hold pods blocked by queue capacity, so Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter do not scale up for quota-only blockers.

### Key Feature Details

### Gang-Aware Preemption and Resource Reclamation (Alpha)

**Background and Motivation**:

Volcano's legacy `preempt` and `reclaim` actions are task-centric. For gang-style jobs, evicting individual tasks from many different victim jobs can create wide disruption without guaranteeing that the pending gang can be scheduled afterward. Some scheduling systems only make the preemptor gang-aware: they try to place the incoming gang as a unit, but still choose victims task by task. That can protect the incoming job while randomly breaking multiple victim gangs.

Volcano v1.15.0 makes both sides of the eviction decision gang-aware. Victim jobs are ordered and selected at job/gang granularity, so the scheduler can reason about the disruption cost of breaking a victim gang instead of treating every task as an interchangeable victim. This distinction is important even when HyperNode topology is not used, because the scheduler still avoids spreading arbitrary partial evictions across unrelated jobs.

This matters especially for training-style workloads. A task-by-task victim loop can evict one replica from many different jobs. If each job depends on gang semantics, one scheduling cycle may break every victim job while still failing to place the incoming gang. Volcano now groups candidate victim tasks by job and evaluates victim bundles. When bundle splitting is available, the scheduler treats resources above the gang requirement, such as `replicas - minAvailable`, as lower-cost safe bundles before considering whole-job disruption. Bundle ordering then follows the action policy first. `gangPreempt` is priority-driven, and `gangReclaim` is fairness-driven. Efficiency based on local gain inside the selected HyperNode versus global disruption is only used after those policy constraints are satisfied.

When HyperNode topology is configured, the new actions additionally scope victim search to HyperNode candidates. Volcano evaluates preemption and reclaim inside a selected topology scope rather than freely preempting across topology domains. The scheduler then runs plugin filtering and placement simulation before committing evictions and nominations, so eviction and placement are evaluated as one scheduling decision.

**Alpha Feature Notice**: Gang-aware preemption and reclamation is alpha and must be enabled explicitly through `gangPreempt` and `gangReclaim`. Future releases may merge these dedicated actions with the legacy `preempt` and `reclaim` actions after the rollout is validated.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Preemptor-gang placement**: Evaluates whether the incoming gang can be placed as a whole before eviction is selected.
- **Victim-gang awareness**: Groups victim candidates by job/gang, prioritizes lower-cost victim bundles such as replicas above `minAvailable`, and avoids spreading partial disruption across many jobs.
- **Topology-scoped eviction**: When HyperNode topology is enabled, searches victims inside the selected topology scope instead of freely preempting across topology domains.
- **Policy-aware victim ordering**: Uses priority for `gangPreempt` and queue fairness for `gangReclaim`, with efficiency used as a secondary ordering signal.

**Configuration**:

```yaml
actions: "enqueue, allocate, backfill, gangPreempt, gangReclaim"
tiers:
- plugins:
  - name: priority
  - name: gang
  - name: drf
  - name: predicates
  - name: nodeorder
  - name: binpack
```

**Note**: Do not configure `gangPreempt`/`gangReclaim` together with the legacy `preempt`/`reclaim` actions in the same scheduler action list.

### DRA Queue Quota in Capacity Plugin

**Background and Motivation**:

Previous Volcano releases already supported scheduling Pods that request Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation resources. The missing part was queue quota: DRA `ResourceClaim` requests were not accounted against `capability`, `deserved`, or `guarantee`, so queues could not control DRA resource usage the same way they control CPU, memory, and extended resources.

Kubernetes DRA introduces `DeviceClass`, `ResourceClaim`, `ResourceClaimTemplate`, and `ResourceSlice`, while Volcano queues already manage quota through `capability`, `deserved`, and `guarantee`. v1.15.0 brings DRA resources into that queue quota model instead of requiring a separate DRA-only quota API.

The capacity plugin now accounts DRA resource requests for queue enqueue and allocation decisions. Operators can limit whole devices or consumable device dimensions such as virtual GPU cores and memory. Shared ResourceClaims are deduplicated so multiple pods referencing the same logical claim do not inflate queue usage.

**Compatibility Note**: DRA quota requires Kubernetes DRA support and a DRA-capable driver. Some DRA allocation modes remain outside the first quota-accounting scope.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Whole-device quota**: Controls DRA `DeviceClass` device counts at queue level.
- **Consumable-capacity quota**: Controls device dimensions such as cores or memory through queue quota.
- **Existing queue semantics**: Applies the same `capability`, `deserved`, and `guarantee` model used by other queue resources.
- **ResourceClaim-aware accounting**: Accounts direct claims, template-created claims, and shared claims without inflating queue usage.

**Configuration**:

```yaml
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: volcano-scheduler-configmap
  namespace: volcano-system
data:
  volcano-scheduler.conf: |

### Pluggable Multi-Sharding Policy Support (Alpha)

**Background and Motivation**:

The v1.14.0 Sharding Controller introduced dynamic node scheduling shards for multi-scheduler deployments. v1.15.0 builds on that architecture by adding pluggable multi-sharding policy support. Instead of relying only on fixed scheduler-level shard parameters, operators can configure an ordered policy pipeline per scheduler shard.

The policy framework runs `filter`, `sort`, and `select` phases per scheduler. Built-in policies support allocation-rate filtering/scoring, warmup-node preference, and node count limiting. Policy configuration can be supplied through a ConfigMap and hot-reloaded at runtime. Invalid updates are rejected while the previous valid configuration remains active.

**Alpha Feature Notice**: The multi-sharding policy framework is still evolving. Future sharding policy extensions are expected to follow this pluggable multi-policy model. Existing top-level sharding fields remain supported for compatibility, while new configurations should use the policy-based format.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Composable shard policies**: Supports filter, scorer, and selector policies in one ordered pipeline.
- **Built-in policy set**: Provides `allocation-rate`, `warmup`, and `node-limit` policies.
- **Per-scheduler shard profiles**: Allows Volcano and Agent Scheduler shards to use different policy chains and utilization ranges.
- **ConfigMap live reload**: Applies valid sharding policy updates without restarting the controller.

**Configuration**:

```yaml
custom:
  sharding_configmap_enable: true
  sharding_configmap_data: |
    schedulerConfigs:
      - name: volcano
        type: volcano
        policies:
          - name: allocation-rate
            weight: 1
            arguments:
              minCPUUtil: 0.0
              maxCPUUtil: 0.6
          - name: node-limit
            arguments:
              minNodes: 1
              maxNodes: 100
      - name: agent-scheduler
        type: agent
        policies:
          - name: allocation-rate
            weight: 1
            arguments:
              minCPUUtil: 0.7
              maxCPUUtil: 1.0
          - name: warmup
            weight: 2
          - name: node-limit
            arguments:
              minNodes: 1
              maxNodes: 100

### Volcano Benchmark and Performance Observability

**Background and Motivation**:

Scheduler performance work needs more than ad hoc test scripts. Contributors and operators need a framework that can set up the environment, run standard workloads, collect performance data, and produce comparable reports with minimal manual steps.

v1.15.0 introduces a benchmark framework for one-click deployment and one-click performance output. It supports local Kind + KWOK environments as well as existing Kubernetes clusters, so contributors can reproduce scheduler performance cases locally and operators can evaluate Volcano in real cluster environments. The framework can deploy monitoring components, run gang and pod scheduling scenarios, collect reports, and help identify scheduling bottlenecks. It also gives new users a baseline for understanding Volcano's practical scheduling throughput and latency before production rollout.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Local benchmark environment**: Runs repeatable benchmark scenarios with Kind and KWOK.
- **Existing-cluster benchmark mode**: Runs the same framework against bare-metal, cloud-managed, or self-hosted Kubernetes clusters.
- **Gang, pod, and topology scenarios**: Covers VolcanoJob gang scheduling, bare pod scheduling, KWOK topology labels, and HyperNode generation.
- **Metrics and reports**: Collects audit-exporter reports, pod timestamp fallback reports, test logs, and Grafana dashboards.
- **Scheduler performance metrics**: Expands scheduler/controller metrics for throughput and latency analysis.

**Quick Start**:

```bash
cd benchmark
make setup VOLCANO_VERSION=v1.15.0
make test-gang-env JOBS=10 REPLICAS=100 MIN_AVAILABLE=100
make cleanup-all
```

### Scheduling Gates for Queue Admission (Alpha)

**Background and Motivation**:

Volcano can mark pods as `Unschedulable` when they are blocked by queue capacity rather than cluster capacity. Cluster Autoscaler and Karpenter commonly interpret `Unschedulable` pods as a signal to add nodes, which can cause unnecessary scale-ups when the actual blocker is queue admission.

Scheduling Gates for Queue Admission uses Kubernetes `schedulingGates` to hold opted-in pods until Volcano determines that the queue has capacity. While gated, pods are invisible to autoscaler scale-up logic. After the gate is removed, normal scheduling proceeds. If the pod still cannot fit any node, autoscalers receive a legitimate scale-up signal.

**Alpha Feature Notice**: Scheduling Gates for Queue Admission is disabled by default and must be enabled on both the scheduler and webhook-manager.

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Per-pod opt-in**: Uses the `scheduling.volcano.sh/queue-allocation-gate: "true"` annotation.
- **Autoscaler-friendly queue admission**: Keeps queue-blocked pods gated so autoscalers do not scale up for quota-only blockers.
- **Queue capacity protection**: Tracks ungated-but-not-yet-bound pods in the capacity plugin to avoid queue over-admission.
- **External gate coexistence**: Keeps the Volcano gate in place while other scheduling gates remain.

**Configuration**:

```bash
helm install volcano volcano/volcano --namespace volcano-system --create-namespace \
  --set custom.scheduler_feature_gates="SchedulingGatesQueueAdmission=true" \
  --set custom.admission_feature_gates="SchedulingGatesQueueAdmission=true"
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
  annotations:
    scheduling.volcano.sh/queue-allocation-gate: "true"
spec:
  schedulerName: volcano
  containers:
  - name: worker
    image: nginx
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: "1"
        memory: "1Gi"

## Other Notable Changes

### Stability and Correctness Highlights

- **Core scheduler stability and capacity correctness**: Improves transaction rollback, preemption/reclaim correctness, queue and inqueue accounting, victim ordering, event-handler synchronization, and scheduler cache safety. The Bug Fixes section lists the individual fixes. Together, they improve scheduler stability under high contention and concurrent event processing. ([#5073](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5073), [#5180](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5180), [#5010](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5010), [#5011](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5011), [#5067](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5067), [#5141](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5141), [#5142](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5142), [#5113](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5113), [#5100](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5100), [#5130](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5130), [#5176](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5176), [#5091](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5091), [#4973](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4973), [#5172](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5172), [#5178](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5178), [#5086](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5086), @hzxuzhonghu, @Sanchit2662, @Aman-Cool, @hajnalmt, @goyalpalak18, @guoqinwill, @qi-min, @zhifei92)
- **Agent Scheduler stability enhancements**: Fixes multi-worker optimistic concurrency conflicts, prevents a shared action instance from reusing different framework/cycle state, registers the missing CSI manager, improves binder node priority behavior when nodes are waiting to be checked, fixes inaccurate E2E duration metrics, and adds e2e coverage. ([#5154](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5154), [#5153](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5153), [#5221](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5221), [#5163](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5163), [#4991](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4991), @JesseStutler, @qi-min, @agrawalcodes)

### Features and Enhancements

- **Kubernetes 1.35 support**: Updates Kubernetes dependencies, generated APIs, fake clients, informers, volumebinding integration, CI/lint tooling, Dockerfile Kubernetes version, and compatibility documentation for Kubernetes 1.35. ([#5000](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5000), [#5039](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5039), [#5062](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5062), @guoqinwill, @hajnalmt)
- **NodeGroup preferred ordering for queues**: Adds `enablePreferredOrder` to the NodeGroup plugin so the order of `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` in queue affinity is meaningful. Earlier nodegroups receive higher scores, allowing queues to prefer fixed resource pools before fallback pools. See the [Preferred Nodegroup Priority Ordering](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/blob/release-1.15/docs/user-guide/how_to_use_nodegroup_plugin.md#preferred-nodegroup-priority-ordering) user guide section for configuration details. ([#5110](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5110), @ruanwenjun)

```yaml
tiers:
- plugins:
  - name: nodegroup
    arguments:
      enablePreferredOrder: true
```

```yaml
apiVersion: scheduling.volcano.sh/v1beta1
kind: Queue
metadata:

spec:
  affinity:
    nodeGroupAffinity:
      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - spark-fixed
      - spark-serverless
```

- **Capacity ancestor reclaim level**: Adds `ancestorReclaimLevel` configuration and documents hierarchical queue reclaim behavior. ([#5115](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5115), @hajnalmt)
- **GPU/vGPU incremental improvements**: Adds GPU exclusivity support to the deviceshare plugin, adds vGPU preemption support, and prevents pods in the same PodGroup from using the same physical vGPU device when disallowed. ([#5213](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5213), [#5235](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5235), [#5049](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5049), @ckyuto, @archlitchi, @goyalankit)
- **Pod-level resource request and limit settings**: Supports pod-level resource request and limit configuration in Volcano Job pod templates. ([#5020](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5020), @Tau721)
- **MPI validation and Argo MPI examples**: Relaxes MPI validation for single-master MPI jobs and adds Argo MPI workflow examples. ([#4956](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/4956), [#5117](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5117), @kingeasternsun, @jrbe228)

### Security Fixes Included

v1.15.0 includes the webhook request body size mitigation for [CVE-2026-44247](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/security/advisories/GHSA-8wxp-xxp2-rcgx). This limits admission webhook request bodies and fixes a denial-of-service risk where an oversized request body could cause the webhook server to run out of memory.

### API Changes

New API, scheduler extension point, and user-facing configuration changes in v1.15.0:

**1. QueueAllocationGate annotation and scheduling gate (Alpha)** (@devzizu)

Adds `scheduling.volcano.sh/queue-allocation-gate` as the opt-in annotation and scheduling gate name for gate-controlled queue admission. The scheduler also adds `--gate-removal-worker-num` to control asynchronous gate-removal workers.

**2. Gang-aware eviction actions and scheduler extension points (Alpha)** (@vzhou-p)

Adds the scheduler actions `gangPreempt` and `gangReclaim`. Both actions support the `allowWholeBundle` argument to control whether whole-job victim bundles may be selected. The default is `true`. The scheduler framework also adds gang-aware eviction support through `UnifiedEvictableFn`, `EvictionContext`, and eviction kinds that allow plugins to distinguish task-level preempt/reclaim from gang-level preempt/reclaim. HyperNode gradient callbacks now take a `SearchPurpose` argument:

```go
type HyperNodeGradientForJobFn func(job *JobInfo, hyperNode *HyperNodeInfo, purpose SearchPurpose) [][]*HyperNodeInfo
type HyperNodeGradientForSubJobFn func(subJob *SubJobInfo, hyperNode *HyperNodeInfo, purpose SearchPurpose) [][]*HyperNodeInfo
```

`PurposeAllocate` and `PurposeEvict` let topology plugins return different search gradients for placement and eviction.

The `Preemptive` extension path is also candidate-list aware in v1.15.0:

```go
type ValidateWithCandidateFn func(interface{}, []*TaskInfo) bool
func (ssn *Session) Preemptive(queue *QueueInfo, candidates []*TaskInfo) bool
```

Plugins can now evaluate reclaim/preempt decisions against a batch of candidate tasks instead of a single task.

**3. DRA quota resource keys and capacity plugin arguments** (@xu-wentao)

Adds reserved key formats for DRA quota in Queue `capability`, `deserved`, and `guarantee`:

- `deviceclass/<DeviceClass>` for whole-device count quota
- `<dim>.deviceclass/<DeviceClass>` for consumable-capacity quota

Adds capacity plugin arguments:

- `capacity.DynamicResourceAllocationEnable`
- `capacity.DRAConsumableCapacityEnable`

**4. DRA scheduling feature gate default** ([#5198](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5198), @t2wang)

Aligns Volcano with Kubernetes 1.34+ DRA defaults by enabling DRA scheduling integration by default. Operators can disable it with `predicate.DynamicResourceAllocationEnable: false`.

**5. DRA ResourceClaim binding RBAC** ([#5151](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5151), @praveen0raj)

Adds `resourceclaims/binding` update and patch permissions to scheduler ClusterRoles for Kubernetes DRA granular status authorization.

**6. Capacity reclaim scope configuration** ([#5115](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5115), @hajnalmt)

Adds the `ancestorReclaimLevel` capacity plugin argument to control how many ancestor levels are considered when hierarchical queues reclaim resources.

**7. Pod-level resource request and limit settings** ([#5020](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5020), @Tau721)

Supports pod-level resource request and limit settings in Volcano Job pod templates.

**8. Pluggable sharding ConfigMap policy format (Alpha)** (@agrawalcodes, @lixmgl)

Adds ConfigMap-driven `schedulerConfigs`, `policies`, `shardSyncPeriod`, and `enableNodeEventTrigger` configuration for live-reloadable sharding policies.

**9. NodeGroup preferred-order scoring** ([#5110](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5110), @ruanwenjun)

Adds the NodeGroup plugin argument `enablePreferredOrder`. When enabled, earlier entries in `preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution` receive higher scores.

**10. GPU exclusivity rules** ([#5213](https://github.com/volcano-sh/volcano/pull/5213), @ckyuto)

Adds the deviceshare plugin argument `deviceshare.GPUExclusiveRules` for label-based exclusive physical GPU use on supported HAMi-core nodes.

**11. Scheduler and webhook flags**

Adds or exposes user-facing operational flags:

- Scheduler `--resource-sync-timeout` waits for initial resource handler synchronization before scheduling starts.
- Scheduler `--gate-removal-worker-num` controls scheduling-gate removal workers.
- Webhook-manager `--enable-queue-allocated-pods-check` rejects queue deletion when allocated pods still exist.
- Webhook-manager `--max-queue-depth` controls maximum hierarchical queue depth.
- Webhook-manager `--enable-root-queue-protection` protects root queue resource attributes.

**12. Helm chart values**

Adds per-component image tag overrides, `scheduler_percentage_nodes_to_find`, and sharding ConfigMap values:

- `custom.controller_image_tag_version`
- `custom.scheduler_image_tag_version`
- `custom.agent_scheduler_image_tag_version`
- `custom.admission_image_tag_version`
- `custom.agent_image_tag_version`
- `custom.scheduler_percentage_nodes_to_find`
- `custom.sharding_configmap_enable`

## Upgrade Instructions

To upgrade to Volcano v1.15.0 after the release is published:

```bash
# Using Helm
helm repo update
helm upgrade volcano volcano-sh/volcano --version 1.15.0

# Using kubectl
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/volcano-sh/volcano/v1.15.0/installer/volcano-development.yaml
```

**Upgrade Notes**:

- Gang-aware preemption and reclamation is opt-in. Configure `gangPreempt` and `gangReclaim` explicitly, and do not use them together with legacy `preempt` and `reclaim` actions in the same scheduler action list.
- `SchedulingGatesQueueAdmission` is opt-in and must be enabled on both scheduler and webhook-manager.
- DRA scheduling integration is enabled by default to align with Kubernetes 1.34+ behavior. Set `predicate.DynamicResourceAllocationEnable: false` if DRA scheduling integration should be disabled.
- DRA queue quota requires Kubernetes DRA support and a DRA-capable driver.
