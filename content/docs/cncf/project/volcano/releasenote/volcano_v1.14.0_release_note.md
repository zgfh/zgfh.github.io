### Key Feature Details

### Scalable Multi-Scheduler with Dynamic Node Scheduling Shard (Alpha)

**Background and Motivation**:

As Volcano evolves to support diverse scheduling workloads at massive scale, the single scheduler architecture faces significant challenges. Different workload types (batch training, AI agents, microservices) have distinct scheduling requirements and resource utilization patterns. A single scheduler becomes a bottleneck, and static resource allocation leads to inefficient cluster utilization.

The Sharding Controller introduces a scalable multi-scheduler architecture that dynamically computes candidate node pools for each scheduler. Unlike strict partitioning, the Sharding Controller calculates dynamic candidate node pools rather than enforcing hard isolation between schedulers. This flexible approach enables Volcano to serve as a unified scheduling platform for diverse workloads while maintaining high throughput and low latency.

**Alpha Feature Notice**: This feature is currently in alpha stage. The NodeShard CRD (Node Scheduling Shard) API structure and the underlying scheduling shard concepts are actively evolving. 

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Dynamic Node Scheduling Shard Strategies**: Compute dynamic candidate node pools based on various policies. Currently supports scheduling shard by CPU utilization, with an extensible design to support more policies in the future.
- **NodeShard CRD**: Manages dynamic candidate node pools for specific schedulers.
- **Large-scale Cluster Support**: Architecture designed to support large-scale clusters by distributing load across multiple schedulers
- **Scheduler Coordination**: Enable seamless coordination among various scheduler combinations (e.g., multiple Batch Schedulers, or a mix of Agent and Batch Schedulers), establishing Volcano as a unified scheduling platform

**Configuration**:

```bash
# Sharding Controller startup flags
--scheduler-configs="volcano:volcano:0.0:0.6:false:2:100,agent-scheduler:agent:0.7:1.0:true:2:100"
--shard-sync-period=60s
--enable-node-event-trigger=true

# Config format: name:type:min_util:max_util:prefer_warmup:min_nodes:max_nodes
```

### Fast Scheduling for AI Agent Workloads (Alpha)

**Background and Motivation**:

AI Agent workloads are latency-sensitive with frequent task creation, requiring ultra-fast scheduling with high throughput. The Volcano batch scheduler is optimized for batch workloads and processes pods at fixed intervals, which cannot guarantee low latency for Agent workloads. To establish Volcano as a unified scheduling platform for both batch and latency-sensitive workloads, we introduce a dedicated Agent Scheduler.

The Agent Scheduler works in coordination with the Volcano batch scheduler through the Sharding Controller (which is introduced in "Scalable Multi-Scheduler with Dynamic Node Scheduling Shard" feature). This architecture positions Volcano as a unified scheduling platform capable of handling diverse workload types.

**Alpha Feature Notice**: This feature is currently in alpha stage and under active development. The Agent Scheduler related APIs, configuration options, and scheduling algorithms may be refined in future releases. 

**Key Capabilities**:

- **Fast-Path Scheduling**: Independent scheduler optimized for latency-sensitive workloads such as AI Agent workloads
- **Multi-Worker Parallel Scheduling**: Multiple workers process pods concurrently from the scheduling queue, increasing throughput
- **Optimistic Concurrency Control**: Conflict-Aware Binder resolves scheduling conflicts before executing real binding
- **Optimized Scheduling Queue**: Enhanced queue mechanism with urgent retry support
- **Unified Platform Integration**: Seamless coordination with Volcano batch scheduler via Sharding Controller

### Network Topology Aware Scheduling Enhancements

**Background and Motivation**:

Volcano v1.14.0 brings significant enhancements to network topology aware scheduling, addressing the growing demands of distributed workloads including LLM training, HPC, and other network-intensive applications.

**Key Enhancements**:

- **SubGroup Level Topology Awareness**: Support fine-grained network topology constraints at the SubGroup/Partition level.
- **Flexible Network Tier Configuration**: Support `highestTierName` for specifying maximum network tier constraints by name.
- **Multi-Level Gang Scheduling**: Improved gang scheduling to support both Job-level and SubGroup-level consistency.
- **Volcano Job Partitioning**: Enable partitioning of Volcano Jobs for better resource management and fault isolation.
- **HyperNode-Level Binpacking**: Optimization for resource utilization across network topology boundaries.

**Configuration Example - Volcano Job**:

### Colocation for Generic OS

This release brings comprehensive improvements to Volcano's colocation capabilities, with a major milestone: **support for generic operating systems** (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.) in addition to OpenEuler. This enables broader adoption of Volcano Agent for resource sharing between online and offline workloads.

**New Features in v1.14.0**:

1. **CPU Throttling (CPU Suppression)**

The CPU usage of online pods dynamically changes. To better isolate online and offline workloads, the CPU quota allocated to offline pods needs to change dynamically according to the actual usage of online pods. When offline pods consume more CPU than their quota, CPU suppression is triggered; if not exceeded, their quota can gradually recover, enabling adaptive resource allocation.

Key design:
- Dynamically adjusts BestEffort root cgroup CPU quota based on node allocatable CPU and real-time usage
- Follows a "monitor-event-handler" architecture with conservative updates to avoid jitter

```yaml
cpuThrottlingConfig:
  enable: true
  cpuThrottlingThreshold: 80      # Allow BE quota up to 80% of allocatable CPU
  cpuJitterLimitPercent: 1        # Emit updates when quota changes by >=1%
  cpuRecoverLimitPercent: 10      # Cap quota increases to 10% per update
```

2. **Memory QoS (Cgroup V2)**

Cgroup V2 based memory isolation for colocation environments. This feature introduces the `ColocationConfiguration` CRD, which allows users to define memory QoS policies for specific workloads. The system automatically applies these policies to matching pods, calculating Cgroup V2 settings (`memory.high`, `memory.low`, `memory.min`) based on the configured percentages and the pod's memory requests/limits.

Key capabilities:
- **New API**: `ColocationConfiguration` CRD for defining memory isolation policies via label selectors
- **Dynamic Calculation**: 
  - `memory.high` = `pod.limits.memory` * `highRatio` %
  - `memory.low` = `pod.requests.memory` * `lowRatio` %
  - `memory.min` = `pod.requests.memory` * `minRatio` %
- **Unified Interface**: Robust detection and support for Cgroup V2 environment

Usage Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: config.volcano.sh/v1alpha1
kind: ColocationConfiguration
metadata:
  name: colo-config1
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: offline-test
  memoryQos:
    # memory.high = memory.limits * 100% (No throttling if 100)
    highRatio: 100
    # memory.low = memory.requests * 50% (Protect 50% of request)
    lowRatio: 50
    # memory.min = memory.requests * 0% (No absolute guarantee)
    minRatio: 0
```

3. **CPU Burst for Generic OS**

Extended CPU Burst support to generic operating systems (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.), allowing latency-sensitive workloads to burst beyond their CPU limits when resources are available.

```yaml
cpuBurstConfig:
  enable: true
```

4. **Cgroup V2 Full Support**

Volcano Agent now fully supports Cgroup V2 environments, ensuring seamless operation on modern Linux distributions.

- **Automatic Detection**: Automatically detects cgroup version (v1/v2) and driver type (systemd/cgroupfs) without manual configuration.
- **Unified Interface**: Adapts internal resource managers (CPU, Memory) to work with both v1 and v2 interfaces.
