<!-- Release notes generated using configuration in .github/release.yml at v2.15.3 -->

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change: webhooks to internal addresses are blocked by default**
>
> The fix for [GHSA-2phj-cp9f-qq6w](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-2phj-cp9f-qq6w) blocks webhook and Slack delivery to private, loopback, link-local and other non-public addresses. That includes hostnames that resolve to them, such as `*.svc.cluster.local`. After you upgrade, existing webhooks to internal endpoints fail to deliver, and new ones are rejected.
>
> To allow them again, set the opt-out on **both core and jobservice**:
> - `harbor.yml`: `network.allow_private_network_access: true`, then `./prepare` and restart
> - Helm: add `{name: HARBOR_ALLOW_PRIVATE_NETWORK_ACCESS, value: "true"}` to both `core.extraEnvVars` and `jobservice.extraEnvVars`
>
> This disables the protection entirely. Only use it if you trust all project admins, and block `169.254.169.254` at the network level.

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change: signing unsigned images fails when content trust is enforced**
>
> The fix for [GHSA-wrw5-gmvj-gf23](https://github.com/goharbor/harbor/security/advisories/GHSA-wrw5-gmvj-gf23) removes the User-Agent based exemption that let `cosign` and `notation` pull unsigned images. In projects that only allow signed images, `cosign sign` and `notation sign` on a new, unsigned image now fail with `412 Precondition Failed`. Images that already have a signature are not affected.
>
> To allow signing clients again, set `CONTENT_TRUST_LEGACY_SIGNER_PULL_ENABLED=true` on **core**. The value must be exactly `true`.
> - Helm: add it to `core.extraEnvVars`
> - `harbor.yml` installs: there is no `harbor.yml` option. Add it to `common/config/core/env` and restart. Re-running `./prepare` overwrites that file.
>
> The exemption still trusts the client's User-Agent, but only for users or robots with push permission on the project. Projects that block vulnerable images have no opt-out: a signing client can no longer pull an image that the vulnerability policy blocks.
