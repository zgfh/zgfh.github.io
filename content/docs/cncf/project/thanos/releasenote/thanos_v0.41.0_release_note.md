# thanos-io/thanos v0.41.0 Release Notes

Published at: 2026-02-12T10:32:11Z

This is a good one, among several bug fixes, we have batched Series and Query RPCs now - this should lead to drastic improvements in network bandwidth and decent improvements in CPU/Memory usage of Querier and all its endpoints.


## Changes

### Fixed
