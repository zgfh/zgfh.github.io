# prometheus/prometheus v3.12.0 Release Notes

Published at: 2026-05-28T17:40:13Z

This release contains security fixes, new features (especially around PromQL and Service Discovery), performance improvements in TSDB, Start Timestamp improvements and numerous bug fixes.

Thanks to all contributors!

## Key Highlights
*   **Security**: Two security vulnerabilities have been addressed: a denial of service in remote-write (snappy decompression limit) and a secret exposure leak in STACKIT service discovery.
*   **PromQL & Metadata**: Several features and bug fixes related to the experimental "start timestamps" support, including updates to `rate()`, `irate()`, `increase()`, and `resets()`. New experimental functions `start()`, `end()`, `range()`, and `step()` are introduced.
*   **TSDB Performance**: Optimizations in head chunk lookup (constant time) and mmap operations to reduce CPU usage.
*   **Service Discovery**: Added support for DigitalOcean Managed Databases and Outscale VM, along with improvements to AWS SD (IPv6 support for EC2, external ID support).
*   **UI**: Added a web interface for deleting time series and cleaning tombstones.

- [SECURITY] STACKIT SD: Fix secrets being exposed in plaintext via `/-/config` endpoint. Thanks to @August829 and @Phaxma for reporting. GHSA-39j6-789q-qxvh #18649
- [CHANGE] TSDB/Agent: Adds Start Timestamp field to all WAL Histogram samples in memory; used `st-storage` flag is enabled. #18221
- [FEATURE] API: Add `/api/v1/status/self_metrics` endpoint returning the current state of the Prometheus server's own metrics about itself as JSON. #18411
- [FEATURE] Discovery: Add DigitalOcean Managed Databases service discovery #18287
- [FEATURE] Prometheus: Add support for the aix/ppc64 compilation target #18321
- [FEATURE] Discovery: Add Outscale VM service discovery (`outscale_sd_configs`) for discovering scrape targets from the Outscale Cloud API. #18139
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Emit a warning when `sort`, `sort_by_label` or `sort_by_label_desc` is used within range (matrix) queries, as these functions do not have effect in that context. #18498
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Add `start()`, `end()`, `range()`, and `step()` experimental functions #17877
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Update `resets()` function to consider start timestamp resets. Hidden behind `use-start-timestamps` feature flag. #18627
- [FEATURE] Prometheus: Promote auto-reload-config as stable #18620
- [FEATURE] TSDB/Agent: Add `CheckpointFromInMemorySeries` option to `agent.DB` that enables checkpoint based on in-memory series. #17948
- [FEATURE] UI: Add a web interface for deleting time series and cleaning tombstones, accessible from the Status menu. #18390
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Use start timestamps for `rate()`, `irate()`, and `increase()` calculations, behind a feature flag `use-start-timestamps`. Doesn't work together with extended range selectors `anchored` and `smoothed`. #18344
- [FEATURE] Scrape: Added a feature flag `st-synthesis` which synthesizes unknown STs for scraped cumulative metrics. Useful when Remote Writing 2.0 with delta or Otel-based backends. #18279
- [FEATURE] promqltest: support `@st` annotation in `load` blocks to specify per-sample start timestamps. #18360
- [ENHANCEMENT] API: reject concurrent fgprof profiles. #18651
- [ENHANCEMENT] AWS SD: Add optional `external_id` field to ECS/MSK/RDS/Elasticache. #18579
- [ENHANCEMENT] AWS SD: Add optional `external_id` field. #17171
- [ENHANCEMENT] Discovery: Propagate SD target updates faster by introducing dynamic backoff interval instead of static 5s interval for throttling. #18187
- [ENHANCEMENT] Promtool: Add `--header` flag to `query instant` command, matching existing `query range` behaviour. #18418
- [ENHANCEMENT]: AWS SD: Allows EC2 service discovery to discover IPv6 addresses to communicate with target endpoints. The private IPv4 address remains the default when both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are present. #16088
- [PERF] TSDB: Make head chunk lookup in range queries constant time instead of quadratic time #18302
- [PERF] TSDB: Skip entire stripes in mmapHeadChunks when no series need mmapping, reducing CPU utilization significantly at production-relevant scales. #18541
- [PERF] TSDB: Skip clean series during periodic head chunk mmap using cached head chunk count #18272
- [PERF] PromQL: Address FloatHistogram.KahanAdd performance regression on Go 1.26. #18568
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix `info()` function incorrectly handling negated `__name__` matchers #17932
- [BUGFIX] API: Return duration expressions in `/parse_ast`. #18624
- [BUGFIX] API: correctly document formats accepted for duration query request parameters (step, timeout and lookback delta) in OpenAPI spec #18305
- [BUGFIX] Scrape: AppenderV2 now tracks staleness even when OOO/duplicate series errors happen similar to AppenderV1 #18567
- [BUGFIX] Config: Validate remote_write queue_config fields at load time to prevent runtime panic and silent misconfiguration. #18209
- [BUGFIX] Discovery/Consul: Add `health_filter` for Health API filtering, fixing breakage when using Catalog-only fields like `ServiceTags` in `filter`. #18479 #18499
- [BUGFIX] OTLP: limit decompressed body size for gzip-encoded OTLP write requests. #18408
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix `smoothed` rate/increase returning zero instead of no result when all data falls strictly after the query range. #18523
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix metric name not being dropped when last_over_time or first_over_time is applied to subqueries containing name-dropping functions like abs(). #18409
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix missing warning when mixing exponential and custom-bucket histograms in stats queries. #18660
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix parsing of `range()` keyword in duration expressions such as `foo[5m+range()]`. #18623
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix smoothed vector selector returning no results in binary operations when the `@` modifier is used. #18531
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Reject NaN, infinite, and out-of-range duration expressions instead of silently producing an out-of-range time.Duration. #18639
- [BUGFIX] Scrape: Fix panic when scraping malformed native histograms. #18414

- [BUGFIX] TSDB/Agent: fix race in agent appender where concurrent appends for the same label set could produce duplicate in-memory series and duplicate WAL records. #18292
- [BUGFIX] Config: Update `--enable-feature`  flag description and sort feature names. #18487
