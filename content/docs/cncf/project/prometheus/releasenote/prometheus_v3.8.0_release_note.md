# prometheus/prometheus v3.8.0 Release Notes

Published at: 2025-12-02T10:11:05Z

## Note for users of Native Histograms

This is the first release with Native Histograms as a stable feature. However, scraping Native Histograms has to be activated explicitly via the `scrape_native_histograms` config setting (newly introduced in this release). To ease the transition, the `--enable-feature=native-histograms` flag is not a complete no-op in this release, but changes the default value of `scrape_native_histograms` to `true`. In the next release (v3.9), the feature flag _will_ be a complete no-op, and the default value of `scrape_native_histograms` will always be `false`. If you have been using the feature flag so far, the recommended course of action is the following:
1. Upgrade to v3.8 and keep the feature flag. Everything should work as before.
2. At your own pace, set `scrape_native_histograms` to `true` in all relevant scrape configs. (There is a global and a per-scrape-config version of  `scrape_native_histograms`, allowing granular control if needed. It is a good idea to also set `scrape_native_histograms` explicitly to `false` where you do not want to scrape Native Histograms. In this way, you do not depend on the default value of the setting anymore.)
3. Remove the feature flag and make sure that everything still works as intended.
4. Now you are ready for an upgrade to the next release (v3.9).
