# prometheus/prometheus v3.14.0 Release Notes

Published at: 2026-08-18T08:49:40Z

- [CHANGE] API: Deprecate the `stats` query parameter of `/api/v1/query` and `/api/v1/query_range` for values other than `true` and `all`. Other values still enable basic statistics but now return a deprecation warning; they will be rejected in the next major release. #19124
- [CHANGE] API: `/api/v1/status/config` now correctly shows `separator: ""` and `replacement: ""` in relabel configs when explicitly set to empty, instead of omitting them. #18653
- [CHANGE] Discovery/Hetzner: Drop the `__meta_hetzner_datacenter` label for `hcloud` targets, following its removal from the Hetzner Cloud API. #19269
- [CHANGE] PromQL: Enable duration expressions by default. The `promql-duration-expr` feature flag is now a no-op. #19033
- [CHANGE] PromQL: Promote `first_over_time` to stable. It no longer requires the `promql-experimental-functions` feature flag. #19093
- [FEATURE] Discovery: Add Oracle Cloud Infrastructure compute service discovery (`oci_sd_configs`). #18919
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Add experimental `start_timestamp(instant-vector)` function returning the start timestamp of each sample in the given vector. Requires the `use-start-timestamps` feature flag. #19089
- [FEATURE] PromQL: Allow `rate()` and `increase()` to use start timestamps as an alternative for rate extrapolation. Hidden behind the `use-start-timestamps` feature flag. #18619
- [FEATURE] TSDB: Add experimental support for encoding start timestamps in histograms and float histograms. Hidden behind the `histograms-st-encoding` feature flag. #18609
- [ENHANCEMENT] OTLP: Emit a warning when OTLP attribute names collide into the same Prometheus label after sanitization (e.g. `k8s.pod.name` and `k8s_pod_name` both become `k8s_pod_name`), and expose the `prometheus_api_otlp_translation_warnings_total` counter labelled by `category` to track such warnings. #18957
- [ENHANCEMENT] Promtool: Add `--remote-write.path` flag to `push metrics` for backends that use a non-default remote-write endpoint. #19086
- [ENHANCEMENT] Remote write: Forward histogram start timestamps in the remote write V2 protocol. #18903
- [ENHANCEMENT] TSDB: Add `prometheus_tsdb_head_native_histogram_series` and `prometheus_tsdb_head_native_histogram_buckets` gauges tracking the number of native histogram series and buckets in the head. #19170
- [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Add syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and linting for PromQL duration expressions (`step()`, `range()`, `min_of()`, `max_of()`) in range selectors and subqueries. #18625
- [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Add copy button next to rule names on the Rules and Alerts pages. #18706
- [ENHANCEMENT] UI: Improve rule group title contrast on the Rules page. #19181
- [PERF] Speed up regex label matchers matching a set of literal values (e.g. `{job=~"foo|bar|baz"}`). #18833
- [PERF] Remote read: Improve remote read throughput by removing unnecessary per-write flushing. #18470
- [PERF] Scrape: Parse text and OpenMetrics formats without recursion, preventing stack overflow from deeply nested or malicious exposition input. #19143
- [PERF] Scrape: Reduce native histogram scrape parsing allocations by ~49%. #19282
- [PERF] TSDB: Speed up queries on series with many in-memory chunks. #18300
- [BUGFIX] Alerting: Fix 100% CPU usage on shutdown that could delay graceful shutdown and trigger timeout-based kills. #17859
- [BUGFIX] Discovery/AWS: Stop `promtool check config` from making AWS metadata service (IMDS) network calls when the `region` field is omitted in EC2, ECS, RDS, MSK, ElastiCache, and Lightsail service discovery configs. #19037
- [BUGFIX] Discovery/Docker: Set a request timeout for `docker_sd` and `dockerswarm_sd` on `unix`, `npipe`, and `tcp` hosts. Previously an unresponsive daemon could freeze discovery indefinitely, silently pinning targets to a stale snapshot. #19237
- [BUGFIX] Discovery/Docker: Fix panic in Docker Swarm service discovery when a service runs as a plugin or network-attachment. #19102
- [BUGFIX] Discovery/Docker: Fix discovery of IPv6-only containers. #18778
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix case-insensitive regex label matchers silently dropping matching values. #19167
- [BUGFIX] PromQL: Fix `mad_over_time` returning 0 instead of `NaN` when the range contains a `NaN` sample. #19040
- [BUGFIX] Promtool: Accept `--enable-feature=promql-binop-fill-modifiers` in `check rules`, which previously rejected valid `fill()`/`fill_left()`/`fill_right()` expressions. #19153
- [BUGFIX] Remote write: Respect the `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE` environment variable for workload identity authentication instead of hardcoding the token file path. #18973
- [BUGFIX] Rules: Clean up stale `rule_group_last_rule_duration_sum_seconds` and `rule_group_last_restore_duration_seconds` series when a rule group is removed or renamed on reload. Previously each reload leaked two series per dropped group, growing `/metrics` cardinality over time. #19107
- [BUGFIX] Scrape: Fix scrape manager spinning at 100% CPU on shutdown. #19149
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix silent data loss and potential crash loop when `stale_series_compaction_threshold` is used in the config file. #19016
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix potential data loss on restart when out-of-order ingestion is enabled and blocks are compacted. #19016
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix `prometheus_tsdb_head_stale_series` over-counting and early eviction of series that change between float, integer histogram, and float histogram sample types. #19183
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix goroutine and file handle leaks when Prometheus fails to open a corrupt TSDB. On Windows, the leaked directory handle also prevented TSDB directory removal. #18291
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix out-of-order queries blocking compaction for hours, causing memory usage to grow. #19013
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix deleted series causing missing samples and errors after restart. #19140
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Fix native histogram data becoming incorrect after restart. #19202
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Surface query errors that were previously silently discarded. #19120
- [BUGFIX] TSDB: Honour the configured float chunk encoding when compaction rewrites chunks; previously chunks encoded with `--enable-feature=xor2-encoding` could silently revert to XOR after compaction. #19145
- [BUGFIX] UI: Show the delete-series form on the TSDB Status page when `--web.enable-admin-api` is enabled. #19025
