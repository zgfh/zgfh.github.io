# coredns/coredns v1.14.7 Release Notes

Published at: 2026-08-19T01:39:14Z

This release strengthens DNS caching, forwarding, and transport reliability, with
improved stale-cache behavior, safer upstream handling, and tighter connection
and overload controls. It also adds new capabilities for ACME-managed TLS,
topology-aware Kubernetes services, HTTP/2 forwarding, DNS-over-QUIC, and
secondary zone management, while delivering correctness and performance fixes
across file serving, rewrites, ACLs, hosts, transfers, and Kubernetes handling.
The release is built with Go 1.26.6 to include fixes for CVE-2026-56865,
CVE-2026-56864, and CVE-2026-33818.
